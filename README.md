Most NGOs donâ€™t have a simple and easy to use solution for people without technical skills or a solution adapted to their specific needs. Website Factory: NGO allows any NGO to easily build a website that provides the main types of content that organizations need, solutions for reporting, fundraising and communication with target audiences, etc.

Website Factory: NGO is a unique solution, developed as a unit, which can be reused by any organization. Thus, each association will have the opportunity to build a website containing essential and relevant information for good communication with donors and the general public. Made of simple, accessible modules that facilitate the publication of information, code of conduct, official documents, with annual report templates and integrated with online donation collection modules, this solution supports pro-bono the entire sector and help NGOs communicate more effectively, increasing their fundraising capacity.

-   Nginx
-   PostgreSQL 14+

## Development
This project uses Laravel Sail, Laravel's default Docker development environment.

After running the [initial setup](#initial-setup), run this command to start up the environment:
```sh
./vendor/bin/sail up -d
```

and then this command to rebuild the css / js assets on change:

# 1. Install composer dependencies
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/app -w /app composer:latest composer install --ignore-platform-reqs --no-scripts --no-interaction --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader

# 2. Copy the environment variables file
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Start the application
./vendor/bin/sail up -d

# 4. Install npm dependencies

## Deployment

The fastest way to deploy Website Factory is by using our first-party [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/code4romania/website-factory).

### Prerequisites

#### Generate an application key

Before deploying Website Factory, make sure you generate a valid application key. If you are not sure what an application key is, you can read more about it here: [`APP_KEY` And You](https://tighten.com/blog/app-key-and-you/) blog post on Tighten's website.

To generate an application key, you can run the following command in your terminal.

```sh
docker run --rm -it code4romania/website-factory php artisan key:generate --show
```

The generated application key will look like this:

```
base64:yEtz1eacKMwq0iVT5BUjMMvcn4OAD7QpCgz1yDoXroE=
```

### Running the image

Download the [example `docker-compose.yml`](docs/examples/docker-compose.yml) and configure the environment variables. Here's where you use the `APP_KEY` generated earlier. After you're done, save the file and run it with:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

You should now be able to access your instance admin area by visiting `<your-ip>:8080/admin` and logging in with the `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` you specified in the configuration.
